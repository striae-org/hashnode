We're excited to announce the release of **Striae v0.9.15.1-beta**, featuring two new significant features in preparation for candidate release on October 1st: **Interactive Box Annotation System** and **Self-Service Account Deletion**. These powerful new capabilities enhance how forensic firearms examiners can document and annotate comparison evidence in Striae.

## üéØ What Are Box Annotations?

Box annotations allow users to draw precise, color-coded rectangles on comparison images to highlight specific areas of interest. Whether you're marking striation patterns, identifying unique characteristics, or documenting evidence details, our new box annotation system provides professional-grade tools with pixel-perfect accuracy.

## üîê Self-Service Account Management

In addition to our powerful annotation features, this release introduces comprehensive self-service account deletion capabilities. Forensic professionals can now take complete control of their data lifecycle, securely removing their accounts and all associated personal information and data directly in the app interface. With multi-step safety confirmations and immediate data purging, this feature ensures compliance with organizational security policies and privacy regulations while maintaining the lifecycle standards required in forensic work.

## üìã Integrated Into PDF Reports

The real power of box annotations becomes apparent in the generated PDF reports. Here are actual examples from our testing:

### Example Report 1: Multiple Annotation Comparison

[**BOX-TEST-1.1 vs BOX-TEST-1.2 Report**](https://www.striae.org/assets/striae-report-123456-BOX-TEST-1.1--123456-BOX-TEST-1.2.pdf)

This report demonstrates how multiple box annotations can be used to highlight different areas of comparison between two forensic images, with precise positioning and color coding maintained in the final document.

### Example Report 2: Rendering Consistency

[**BOX-TEST-5.2 vs BOX-TEST-6.8 Report**](https://www.striae.org/assets/striae-report-123456-BOX-TEST-5.2--123456-BOX-TEST-6.8.pdf)

This example showcases the seamless transition from interactive canvas annotations to professional PDF output, demonstrating pixel-perfect consistency between the web interface and final documentation.

## üöÄ Why This Matters for Forensic Professionals

### Enhanced Documentation

Box annotations provide a standardized way to mark areas of interest, making your analysis more precise and your reports more compelling.

### Improved Collaboration

Color-coded annotations allow team members to quickly understand different types of findings and focus areas.

### Professional Presentation

Generated PDF reports with embedded annotations create professional documentation suitable for court presentations and expert testimony.

### Workflow Efficiency

The seamless integration between interactive annotation and final report generation streamlines the entire forensic analysis workflow. Making additional annotations won‚Äôt require the user to work outside of Striae or edit the image manually.

### Data Security & Compliance

Self-service account deletion provides forensic professionals with complete control over their data, ensuring compliance with organizational security policies and privacy regulations while maintaining professional accountability.
