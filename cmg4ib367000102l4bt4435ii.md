> Striae introduces an enhanced Authenticated Confirmations System, simplifying digital confirmations by allowing seamless annotations and secure data transfers with cryptographic stamps. The new audit trail feature logs all user activities for comprehensive tracking, ensuring data integrity and compliance with QA standards. Additionally, Striae supports collaboration through Case Review Accounts, enabling cross-agency reviews. The upcoming Release Candidate, available October 1st, welcomes early testers ahead of the full release in January. Setup involves simple deployment steps using Cloudflare, Firebase, and SendLayer, with a deployment time of 30-45 minutes.

As we near October 1st, we‚Äôve improved many facets of Striae, added new features and workflows, and strengthened several security protocols. Of particular note is the Authenticated Confirmations System‚Äîthe pride and joy of Striae.

## Authenticated Digital Confirmations

Gone are the days of organizing images, repetitively creating labels and annotations for each one, and hoping everything is in order before transferring them to your colleague for confirmation. Now, with Striae, you can seamlessly annotate your comparisons as you perform your microscopy, then simply export the case package‚Äîwhich includes all your uploaded images and notes‚Äîfor confirmation. After that, it‚Äôs just a matter of transferring the physical evidence (which Striae can‚Äôt help with) and waiting to receive the confirmation file. Once received, all you have to do is import it into Striae, and all confirmations are automatically applied! When you‚Äôre ready to compile your entire case for tech review, just print all the images, which will include every confirmation detail.

*‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù you ask, ‚Äúhow do I know data transfers outside of Striae remain intact, and what about chain of custody?‚Äù* Never fear: all data exported from and imported into Striae is cryptographically stamped with a tamper-proof signature that‚Äôs automatically validated during import. Confirmations receive an additional unique ID at the time of confirmation, so you can double- and triple-check data authenticity. Every data modification is captured in Striae‚Äôs audit trail, which you can archive along with the complete case package for easy access (for inquisitive auditors).

Striae has made **authenticated digital confirmations** easy as pie. To learn more about this workflow, check out the [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/C95Wl0r3zeM), which covers every step from case creation to confirmation.

## Retracing Your Steps: A Comprehensive Audit Trail

The next big feature will satisfy even the most stringent QA department. Striae tracks and logs every user action, case management activity, and data modification snapshot, creating **a complete, exportable audit trail**. See an example below:

Even confirmation activity is fully tracked: Striae captures an audit trail when an examiner imports a case, performs a confirmation, and exports the data back to you.

Auditors can follow the yellow brick road all the way from case creation to confirmation.

## For Your Eyes Only: External Review Accounts

If you encounter a situation where a case needs reviewing or confirming by someone outside your agency (and thus not a registered user in your Striae instance), there‚Äôs a solution.

A **Case Review Account** is a special, read-only account that you can create at registration. This account can't create cases or upload images‚Äîit‚Äôs strictly for reviewing and confirmations. Confirmations and case imports can only be completed by authenticated users within a given Striae instance. So, if you send data to someone who uses Striae in a different database, they won‚Äôt be able to import or confirm your case. Case Review Accounts solve this dilemma by providing a limited-access account, enabling cross-agency reviews and confirmations.

This is one way Striae works to foster collaboration among the firearms examiner community and forensic labs as a whole.

## Look for the Release Candidate October 1st!

The Release Candidate is our chance to conduct final testing and proof-of-concept before the full release in January. If you‚Äôd like to try Striae, contact your IT department and have them set up an instance for your department! We aimed to make setup as easy as annotating your comparison images. And don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you or your IT admins need help with setup or usage!

## **üöÄ Quick Start Install**

Ready to deploy Striae? Follow these steps to get your own instance running:

### **Prerequisites**

* **Cloudflare Account** with a registered domain
    
* **Firebase Project** with Authentication enabled and MFA configured. You‚Äôll need your Firebase:
    
    * API Key
        
    * Authorized Domain
        
    * Project ID
        
    * Storage Bucket
        
    * Messaging Sender ID
        
    * App ID
        
    * Measurement ID (optional)
        
* **SendLayer Account** for email services. Create and note your API key.
    
* **Node.js** v20+ and Git
    

### **Cloudflare Services Setup**

Set up these Cloudflare services first:

* **Turnstile** (bot protection)
    
    * Public/Site Key
        
    * Private Key
        
* **Images** (file storage)
    
    * Account ID
        
    * Account Hash
        
    * Create an Images API token and note it
        
    * HMAC Signing Key
        
* **KV** (user database) - Create a namespace
    
    * Namespace UUID (not name)
        
* **R2** (data and audit storage) - Create two buckets, configure CORS (see [installation guide](https://developers.striae.org/striae-dev/get-started/installation-guide#24-cloudflare-r2-setup))
    
    * Data bucket name
        
    * Audit bucket name
        

### **Deployment Steps**
