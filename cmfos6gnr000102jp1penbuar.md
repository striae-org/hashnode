In forensic examination, transparency isn't just a best practice‚Äîit's essential for credibility, peer review, and maintaining the integrity of evidence analysis. Today, we're excited to announce Striae v0.9.17a-beta, a significant step forward in making forensic workflows more transparent and comprehensive through advanced case export capabilities.

With Striae's latest release, we're addressing this issue head-on with a complete case export system.

## üñºÔ∏è Complete Case Archival with ZIP Exports

The centerpiece of this release is our new **ZIP Export System with Images**. Now, users can export complete case packages that include not just annotation data, but all associated images in a single, organized archive.

### Why This Matters

Previously, sharing a case required multiple steps:

1. Create annotation data
    
2. Separately gather images
    
3. Manually organize files
    
4. Hope nothing gets lost in translation
    

Now, with a single click and the "Include Images" checkbox in Striae, examiners can create comprehensive case packages that contain:

* **Structured annotation data** in JSON, CSV, or Excel format
    
* **All case images** automatically packaged and organized
    
* **Professional ZIP archives** using industry-standard JSZip library
    
* **Organized directory structure** for easy navigation
    

This means when you need to package a case for an audit, peer collaboration, or when you need to archive a completed case, everything is included in one professional package.

## üìä Enhanced Data Structure for Analysis

### Box Annotation Analysis Made Simple

One of the essential planned features for Striae was better handling of box annotations in Excel exports. Previously, multiple box annotations were condensed, making individual review difficult. Now:

* **Each box annotation becomes a separate row** in Excel files
    
* **Complete coordinate data** (x, y, width, height) for each annotation
    
* **Color coding information** preserved for visual analysis
    
* **Timestamp data** for annotation creation tracking and auditing
    

This change makes it significantly easier to:

* Analyze annotation patterns across cases
    
* Generate statistical reports on examination techniques
    
* Conduct quality assurance reviews
    
* Integrate with external analysis tools
    

## üßπ Behind the Scenes: Code Quality & Architecture

While users will immediately notice the export improvements, this release also represents significant work on code quality and system architecture.

### TypeScript Cleanup Initiative

We've systematically centralized all primary type definitions, removed unused type definitions, and optimized our TypeScript architecture:

* **annotations.ts** - Includes type definitions specific to annotations
    
* **case.ts** - Includes type definitions specific to case information
    
* **file.ts** - Includes type definitions specific to image and file data
    
* **user.ts** - Includes type definitions specific to user data
    
* **index.ts** - Barrel exports for all type definitions
    

### Why This Technical Work Matters

Clean, well-organized code isn't just about developer satisfaction‚Äîit directly impacts:

* **System reliability**: Fewer locally declared interfaces mean fewer potential bugs
    
* **Performance**: Optimized imports reduce bundle size
    
* **Maintainability**: Clear type organization makes current structures easier to expand and future features easier to implement
    
* **User experience**: More reliable code means more reliable exports
    

## üìö Comprehensive Documentation Updates

Transparency isn't just about exporting data‚Äîit's also about clear, comprehensive documentation. This release includes updates to:

* **API Reference**: Current type definitions and interface documentation
    
* **Architecture Guide**: ZIP export system details and type organization
    
* **Component Guide**: New export features and interface changes
    
* **User Guides**: ZIP export instructions and workflow documentation
    

## Experience the Difference

The improvements in **v0.9.17a-beta** represent months of development focused on a single goal: making forensic examination more transparent, comprehensive, and reliable.

Whether you're preparing for court testimony, collaborating with a peer, or managing laboratory quality assurance for external audits, these new export capabilities provide the tools you need to maintain the highest standards of forensic transparency for your data.
