As we approach our January release, we’re excited to introduce a major update that further streamlines collaboration in forensic firearms analysis. Building on our recent case export feature, Striae now supports **case import and review**—empowering examiners to seamlessly work together across agencies or teams.

With this capability, when a peer or co-worker exports a case package from Striae, you can directly import it into your own Striae’s read-only environment. Instantly, you’ll gain access to all the original case images, detailed annotations, and related examination data—enabling efficient and transparent peer review or secondary analysis, all within the same secure platform.

This enhancement not only improves the review workflow, but also supports best practices in evidence handling and documentation. It’s designed to foster trust and reproducibility in forensic comparisons, ensuring everyone in your team can easily access and audit the same comprehensive record.

We remain dedicated to making forensic firearms analysis easier, more collaborative, and more reliable for examiners worldwide. This release brings us another step closer to our vision—a connected community of firearm examiners working with clarity, precision, and accountability.
