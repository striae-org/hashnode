Forensic firearms identification remains rooted in manual, disjointed workflows that compromise efficiency, accuracy, and collaboration. Examiners capture high-resolution comparison images but must leave specialized microscopy environments to annotate and document findings in general-purpose applications or other analog methods. This separation introduces transcription errors, version-control challenges, and time-consuming processes that slow case throughput and hinder peer review.

Striae transforms this paradigm by offering a cloud-native forensic annotation platform purpose-built for firearms examiners. Leveraging Cloudflare’s global edge network, Striae integrates comparison microscopy image management, real-time annotation and linking, and cryptographically authenticated confirmations into a single, secure environment. Examiners benefit from intuitive, firearms evidence-focused annotation tools, tamper-evident AES-256-encrypted audit trails, and automated digital signatures that preserve chain of custody and support non-repudiation. Multi-examiner workflows (confirmations) ensure consistent reporting and verification, while version control and export services provide full historical context for quality assurance and clear courtroom presentation.

Reducing documentation time and reducing clerical errors can potentially yield significant labor-cost savings and backlog reduction. By centralizing data management, standardizing processes, and enhancing evidence integrity, Striae accelerates case processing, strengthens scientific rigor, and elevates the credibility of expert testimony. As the first cloud-native annotation solution for firearms identification, Striae effectively bridges traditional comparison microscopy with modern digital workflows—empowering laboratories to deliver faster, more reliable forensic results in service of justice.
