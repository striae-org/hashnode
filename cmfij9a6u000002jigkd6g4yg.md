> Striae is a pioneering cloud-native forensic annotation application designed for firearms examiners, offering specialized workflows, data management, and reporting functions. Leveraging Cloudflare's global infrastructure, Striae provides secure, scalable, and accessible digital note-taking for forensic professionals worldwide, with features like global deployment, robust data security, and reduced operational costs, addressing a crucial niche in forensic technology.

## **The Origins of Striae**

Through my experience as a forensic firearms examiner, I encountered a critical bottleneck in the comparison workflow: making detailed, concurrent annotations on comparison images was both cumbersome and inefficient. Existing methods forced me and my fellow examiners to print images separately from the comparison workflow and mark them up manually, providing no streamlined way to link annotations directly to the digital evidence. This time-consuming process could take up to an hour per casefile, especially in complex investigations.

Striae was created to streamline forensic comparison workflows by providing an intuitive, cloud-based platform for direct digital annotation and evidence linking. With Striae, examiners can quickly annotate comparison images, seamlessly associate notes with specific evidence, and create well-formatted reports, all in the same workflow environment. Striae transforms painstaking manual tasks into an efficient, integrated digital process, empowering examiners to focus on what matters most: analysis and reporting.

Striae is one of the first, and potentially the very first, cloud-native forensic annotation applications built specifically for forensic firearms examination—a highly specialized area seldom addressed by existing forensic technology platforms. This innovative solution harnesses global cloud infrastructure (leveraging Cloudflare) to deliver unmatched capabilities in accessibility, security, and operational efficiency for firearms examiners worldwide.

## **Benefits of Being Cloud-Native (with Cloudflare)**

### **Global Deployment**

Striae's cloud-based architecture allows examiners to securely access their cases and tools from virtually anywhere with an internet connection, facilitating remote collaboration and evidence review regardless of physical lab location.

### **Data Security**

Cloudflare protection means industry-leading safeguards against DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, and application-layer threats. Zero Trust policies, web application firewalls, and global traffic monitoring provide strong defense for sensitive forensic data.

### **Low Overhead**

As a cloud-native platform, Striae eliminates the need for organizations to manage local servers or complex IT infrastructure, reducing both up-front and ongoing operational costs. Cloudflare's network optimizations also drive down latency and maintenance expenses, ensuring reliable 24/7 service.

### **Scalability**

Cloudflare's globally distributed network is engineered to seamlessly handle millions of requests per second, automatically scaling to meet demand regardless of workload spikes or geographic location. There is no general upper limit to requests per second for well-intentioned traffic, and Cloudflare's infrastructure dynamically distributes requests across thousands of servers worldwide, ensuring reliable service even under exceptionally high traffic.

For example, Cloudflare Workers—one of the foundational technologies for cloud-native apps—are designed to process massive traffic bursts and maintain consistent performance at global scale, which enables applications like Striae to serve forensic professionals without service degradation or bottlenecks.

This built-in scalability is a core benefit for Striae, assuring that even sudden surges in usage or the concurrent processing of large forensic data sets will not disrupt performance or availability.

### **Efficient Incident Handling**

Automated evidence preservation, cloud-native traceability, and seamless audit logging accelerate response and minimize disruption if incident review or security triage is needed.
