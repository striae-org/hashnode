**The Striae beta period has officially opened!** With a little less than 10 months in the making (but the idea began percolating in my brain years ago), this project has grown to full fruition. There were many frustrating periods during development, and there were a few times when it seemed like the barriers were too great to overcome. But, with patience, a little creativity in design, and a lot of persistence, the final product is a system that gives me great joy to open to the world.  

The beta period will run from September 1st until full release on **January 1st, 2026**. This gives users and myself plenty of time to work out any leftover bugs, make UI/UX improvements, and add additional features or utilities.  

Welcome to Striae.
